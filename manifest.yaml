                          specific requirements or configurations.

                          In a scenario where specialized backup options are required, such as setting
                          a specific timeout or defining custom behavior, users can use this field

                              All of a Pod's containers must have the same effective HostProcess value
                              (it is not allowed to have a mix of HostProcess containers and non-HostProcess containers).
                              In addition, if HostProcess is true then HostNetwork must also be set to true.

                              PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.
